## Programming with JavaScript

Let's discuss programming with JavaScript. We'll break out the information we need to know into scripts, expressions and operators, as well as functions.

### Scripts

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer follows to achieve a goal.
- Each time it runs, it might only use a subset
- Your script for instructions must let a computer solve the task programatically.
- Break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete the task. Perhaps flowchart the tasks.

### Expressions and operators

- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate value.

For more, including code code examples, see pages 74 - 79 of Jon Duckett's "JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developments".

### Functions

- Functions consist of a series of statements grouped together to perform a specific function.
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters and may return a value.
- Objects are properties and methods.
- Built-in objects come with the browser like a toolkit
