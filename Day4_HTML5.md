## Structure web pages with HTML

Let's discuss how to structure web pages with Hypertext markup language (HTML).

To write your first website, you'll need to consider process and design. The structure of the web pages will be important, too. And, web designers draw on their knowledge of HTML5 layout and extra markup.

### Process and design
How to approach building a website? You'll need to understand your audience and what they need. Then you can decide how to present information your audience *wants* to see.
Here are a few key points:
- You need to understand your target audience: Why do they come to your website? What information do they want to find? When are they likely to come back?
- Use a site map to plan the structure of your website. The card sorting technique may help with this.
- Wireframes help you organize the information on each page, starting with the first page. Graphics tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign can help build wireframes. Two online tools to consider include:
  - [Go Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com)
  - [Lovely Charts](https://lovelycharts.com)
- Give visual queues to your audience by maintaining a hierarchy of how items appear on your website. Stay consistent and true to the visual hierarchy throughout.
- Use size, color, and style to differentiate information.
- Grouping and similarity lead to simplicity of presentation. Some essential parts of a page must look to be distinct from the content that surrounds it.

For a deeper discussion of process and design, refer to Chapter 18 of Jon Duckett's ["HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites"](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/).

### Structure
Structure helps visitors to your website understand the information you want to convey. HTML provides a structure to web pages by using tags or elements.
- HTML pages *are* text documents.
- HTML uses characters that sit inside angled brackets ('<', '>') that function as containers for the information between them.
- In general and with only a few exceptions, tags come in pairs: opening and closing.
- Opening tags carry attributes that tell us a bit more about the content of that element.
- Attributes need a name and a value.
- Web designers need to know the tags that are available, what they can do, and where they go.

### HTML5 Layout
Note: HTML5 elements are common to the vast majority of web pages

HTML5 includes layout elements. Older browsers still need to understand newer elements. Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS.

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure
- The new elements provide clearer code vs using multiple '<div>' elements
- Older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements
- To make HTML5 elements work on IE 8 and older versions of IE, extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google

### Extra Markup
Extra markup enables you to specify different versions of HTML, identify and group elements, as well as to comment, provide meta info, and iframes.

- DOCTypes tell browsers which version of HTML you're using
- You can add comments to your code between the '<! -- and -->' markers
- The 'id' and 'class' attributes enable you to identify particular elements
- The 'div' and 'span' elements enable you to group block-level and inline elements together
- 'iframes' cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed
- The 'meta' tag enables you to supply all kinds of info about your web page
- Escape characters are used to include special characters such as angle brackets ('<', '>') and several symbols such as copyright (&copy;), ampersand (&amp;), currencies.
