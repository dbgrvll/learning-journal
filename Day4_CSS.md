## Design web pages with CSS
To design attractive web pages, you'll use a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). You'll use color to establish a mood or to make your pages readable and easy to look at again and again.

### CSS
Here's some handy info abut what a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) does, how CSS works, rules, properties, and CSS values.
- CSS handles each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicatre how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors and declarations.
- Different types of selectors allows you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declararions are made of two parts: properties of the element that you want to change and the values of thiose properties. For example, font-family property sets the choice of font and the value Arial as the desired typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate doc although sometimes the're in an HTML page.

For a deeper discussion of process and design, refer to Chapter 10 of Jon Duckett's ["HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites"](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/).

- Color coneys mood and evokes reactions
