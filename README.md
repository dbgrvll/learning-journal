I'm David Gravelle (or "dbgrvll"). Well into my career as a technical writer, I'm learning to code. As you read this learning journal, please remember:
> be kind.


## What is this learning journal?

I'll use this learning journal to always be kind to my colleagues in tech by always, always leaving behind a record of what I have done and how I did it.

## The growth mindset
As I learn to code, I'm going to practice a growth mindset in many ways. Here are a few examples:
- I'll try to **figure things out** as best as I can
- I won't **give up** after the first fail, or the second fail, or the third fail
- I'll **ask questions** when I have them

## Selecting a text editor

Software developers use text editors to write code as they create web sites and applications. These editors are different from the word processors we use to write resumes, newsletters, and other documents. There are a number of editors to consider:

## Which editor to select?

Here's why itâ€™s important for you to be thoughtful about the editor you use to write code:

- Cost - Many editors are open source, free, or near- free
- Features -  Syntax highlighting, code completion, others that make work easier and speedier
- Operating systems - Available for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Languages - Supports python, javascript, ruby, html, css, php, or other languages you need
