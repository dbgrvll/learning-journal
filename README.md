## Introduction

I'm David Gravelle. Many years into my career as a technical writer and editor, I'm learning to code. As you read this learning journal, please remember to be kind.

## What is this learning journal?

I'll use this learning journal to always be kind to my colleagues in tech by always, always leaving behind a record of what I have done and how I did it.

## The growth mindset
As I learn to code, I'm going to practice a growth mindset in many ways. Here are a few examples:
- I'll try to figure things out as best as I can
- I won't give up after the first fail, or the second fail, or the third fail
- I'll ask questions when I have them
