## Introduction

:fleur_de_lis:I'm David Gravelle. Well into my career as a technical writer and editor, I'm learning to code. As you read this learning journal, please remember to be kind.

## What is this learning journal?

:fleur_de_lis:I'll use this learning journal to always be kind to my colleagues in tech by always, always leaving behind a record of what I have done and how I did it.

## The growth mindset
:fleur_de_lis:As I learn to code, I'm going to practice a growth mindset in many ways. Here are a few examples:
- I'll try to **figure things out** as best as I can
- I won't **give up** after the first fail, or the second fail, or the third fail
- I'll **ask questions** when I have them
