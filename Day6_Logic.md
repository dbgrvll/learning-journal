## Computer Architecture and Logic

### Loops
- for - If you need to run code a specific number of times.
- while - If you need the code to run for as long as a condition is true.
- do...while - If you need the code to run at least once and then run for as long as a condition is true.

For more, see page 170 of Jon Duckett's ["JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developments"](http://javascriptbook.com/).

#### Loop counters

- 'i' (or 'index') - If you want to create a variable and set it, write an initialization loop counter.
- '<', '<=' - If you want a loop to continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number. 
- 'i++', 'i--' - If you want to add to ('++') or subtract ('--') from the counter after running the statements inside the curly braces ('{','}').

For more, including code snippets, see page 171 of of Jon Duckett's "JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developments".

#### Looping

Example:

'for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}'

Step-by-step:

- Variable i (the counter) is assigned a value of zero.
- The condition is checked. Less than 10?
- The code inside the curly brackets is run.
- Variable (i) is used to write a number to the page.
- The variable is incremented by one.
- When condition checks to a number equal to 10, the loop ends.

#### Key loop concepts

- Keywords - Here are two common keywords:
  - 'break' - Terminates the loop.
  - 'continue' - Continue and check the condition again.
- Loops, arrays
- Performance issues

For more, see page 174 of of Jon Duckett's "JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developments".

#### Using 'for' loops

- Often used to loop through items in an array.
- Example provided in the book for scores for each round of a test in an array called 'scores'.

For more, including a code sample, see page 175 of of Jon Duckett's "JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developments".

#### Using while loops

- May be used when you do not know how many times you might want the code to run. 
- Example provided in the book is of a 5 times table set to run 10 times.
- This section also provides a shortcut '+=' operator that stands in for 'msg = msg + 'new msg'.
