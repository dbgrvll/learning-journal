## Activate web pages with JavaScript

### Writing a script for a web page
To write a script, you'll want to understand how JavaScript language fits with HTML and CSS in your web pages.
- HTML is the content layer. It provides structure and semantics.
- CSS is the presentation layer. It enhances the HTML content is presented by setting rules about backgrounds, borders, colors, and more. 
- JavaScript is about the behavior of the website. 

For more detail, refer to pages 43 - 45 of Jon Duckett's ["JavaScript &amp; JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development"](http://javascriptbook.com/).

### Objects and methods
- Programmers refer to calling a method of an object. Here's an example:

'document.write('Good afternoon!');'

- JavaScript runs where it is found in the HTML of a web page.
- Each script is made up of statements.
- Scripts contain precise instructions. 
- Variables temporarily store information.
- Arrays are variables that store more than one piece of information.
- Programmers use shorthand for creating variables.
- Some rules for naming variables:
Note: A full list of keywords and reserved words are included [online](http://javascriptbook.com/)
  - Begin with a letter, the dollar sign ('$', or an underscore ('_').
  - Don't use a dash ('-') or a period ('.').
  - No keywords or reserved words such as 'var'.
  - All variables are case sensitive.
  - Use a name that is meaningful and gives an idea of the function
  - Capitalize the first letter of each word following the first in multi-word variables. For example, 'firstName' rather than 'firstname'.
